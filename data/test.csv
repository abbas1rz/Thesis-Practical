A blanket of snow outside
And all my friends and family
And though I know that you're no farther than a call away
I need to see your face
A call could never be the same

Oh, war is an enemy to all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest within the younger generation
Induction, then destruction
Who wants to die?

What is it good for?
Absolutely
Nothing
Say it, say it, say it

Uh-huh, yeah (Huh!)

Nothing
Listen to me
War
It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War
It's got one friend, that's the undertaker

Oh, war has shattered many a young man's dreams
Made him disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious
To spend fighting wars each day
War can't give life
It can only take it away

Oh, war
Huh!
Good God, ya'll

But Lord knows there's got to be a better way

There's a forest fire burning bright
Spreading quickly towards our last rites
Nowhere to run, pointless to hide
Just lay there and scream pretending to try
Pretending
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it

Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and you burn
This impending doom is left deep inside
And it's haunting you each and every night
Like starving wolves counting sheep
We close our eyes, pretending to sleep
Descending
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it

Like hell, burning silently strong

Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue, like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So, here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight
[Verse 2]
She brought colors to my life
That my eyes have never touched
When she taught me how to care
I never cared so much
I try not to think of her, but I fall asleep and do
And drift off where the grass is green and the sky is baby blue
[Chorus]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue, like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So, here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

Recited it over a Hip-Hop beat

Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough
