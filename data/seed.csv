ML1;Usher;There Goes My Baby;relaxed;"er baby... okay, yeah man
Right... (turn the lights off)

There goes my baby
(Ooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Ooh, girl, look at you

Bet you ain't know that I be checking you out when you be putting your heels on
I swear, your body's so perfect, baby
How you work it, baby yeah, whoo!
I love the way that you be poking it out, girl
Give me something to feel on
So please believe we gone be twerking it out
By the end of the night, baby

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
(Not even for a minute)
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon' hear me say

There goes my baby
(Ooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Ooh, girl, look at you

I get the chills whenever I see your face and you in the place, girl
Feel like I'm in a movie, baby
I'm like, ""Oowee, baby""
Like waterfalls, your hair falls down to your waist
Can I get a taste, girl?
No need to creep, 'cause baby, I ain't ashamed
Of calling your name, girl

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon' hear me say

There goes my baby
(Ooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Ooh, girl, look at you

And girl, I feel like it's our first time every time we get together
Baby, loving you feels better than
Everything, anything
Put on my heart, you don't need a ring
And I promise
Our time away won't change my love

There goes my baby
(Ooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Ooh, girl, look at you
There goes my baby
(Ooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Ooh, girl, look at you"
ML2;Da'Ville;On My Mind;relaxed;"Hidden underneath the floor
In the attic of my dreams, there's somebody I adore
I could smile, I could lie
Say, I never think about you at all, most of the time

Maybe it's the way the clouds are painted a perfect shade of yellow all across the sky
Maybe it's the way the times are changing, and I'm stuck in the middle, frozen in a fire
But, baby, you're on my mind

Doors will open, doors will close
In the basement of my dreams, there's somebody I ignore, mm
Yeah, I'm a fool, don't be surprised
I don't ever think about you at all
But right now, I just need you to know

Maybe it's the way the clouds are painted a perfect shade of yellow all across the sky
Maybe it's the way the times are changing, and I'm stuck in the middle, frozen in a fire
But, baby, you're on my mind

You showed up
Crystal and casually
Our love was what it had to be
You showed up
Like you're still attached to me
Our love was what it had to be (had to be, had to be)

Maybe it's the way the clouds are painted a perfect shade of yellow all across the sky
Maybe it's the way the times are changing, and I'm stuck in the middle, frozen in a fire
But, baby, you're on my mind

You're on my mind

Baby, you're on my mind"

Send me a sign, for my body's aligned

My pores are wide open
And bleed for your potion

And when the fog rises
Somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore [Verse 3]
There's nothing to keep you (Nothing to keep you)
From falling in love
It starts at the bottom (Starts at the bottom)
And comes from above
Like pieces of a puzzle
Like a hand in a glove

And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride

As I dream to live a life that seems to be

A lost reality

That can never find a way to reach my inner

In the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to

See through the gray that clouds my mind?

This time I look to see what's between the lines

The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry, ow!

And when the story takes a twist
It folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry [Bridge]

My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face

Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again, and again and again, again

""Which is the way he wants it!""
""Well, he gets it!""
""N' I don't like it any more than you men""

Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before
[Verse 4]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
[Verse 5]
D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said ""Peace could last forever""
And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land
[Verse 6]
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
You're power hungry sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
[Verse 7]
Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
[Verse 8]
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more
[Verse 9]
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars
[Verse 10]
""We practice selective annihilation of mayors and government officials for example, to create a vacuum""
""Then we fill that vacuum""
""As popular war advances peace is closer""

I don't need your civil war
You're power hungry sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store

Another Christmas day
Will come and go away
I got so far to go
But I wanna go home
I need to go home

Maybe surrounded by
Strangers and Christmas lights
I shouldn't feel so alone
But I wanna go home
God, I miss you, you know
I can close my eyes and see the angel on the tree
A blanket of snow outside
And all my friends and family
And though I know that you're no farther than a call away
I need to see your face
A call could never be the same

Another Christmas day
Will come and go away
And I won't leave you alone
I wanna go home

I wanna go home

So I'll do the things I gotta do to get back to you
I need you to believe
I'll make it back by Christmas Eve

[Chorus: Michael Bublé]
Another Christmas day will come and go away
And I won’t leave you alone

I'm gonna go home
Babe, I miss you, you know

Down in the hole some emotions are hard to hide

Would you take me in? Are you lonely in the dark?

In the dark
You never listen to the voices inside
They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide
You're never sure if the illusion is real
You pinch yourself but the memories are all you feel
Can you break away from your alibis?
Can you make a play? Will you meet me in the dark?

You make the rounds, ah you try to be so sincere
You guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams
You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene
Can you face the fire when you see me there?
Can you feel the fire? Will you love me in the dark?

By a love that's gone wrong
Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you and me
Always I know our love will be
Just between you
Just between you and me
Words are sometimes hard to find
The silence can be so unkind
You always help me find my way
The love that we share
Grows stronger each day
Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you and me
Always I know our love will be
Seulement entre toi et moi
Means that our love will always be
Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you
Just between you and me"

Crashing inside you like motorbikes
We toss and turn, sleep so loud
Grind the teeth in our
Our empty mouths are empty
There's a forest fire burning bright
Spreading quickly towards our last rites
Nowhere to run, pointless to hide
Just lay there and scream pretending to try
Pretending
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and you burn
This impending doom is left deep inside
And it's haunting you each and every night
Like starving wolves counting sheep
We close our eyes, pretending to sleep
Descending
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and
Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home
As we burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and
Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home
Right now, this hell is my home"

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up when the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little blue birds fly across the rainbow, why oh why can't I?"

[Verse 3]
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
No one would you see
[Verse 4]
Ask yourself, who could it be?
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I hate to say it, I hate to say it
But it's probably me
[Verse 5]
You're not the easiest person I've ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way, you'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy who'd lay down his life or you and die
It's hard to say it, I hate to say it
But it's probably me
[Verse 6]
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
The jury's out and your eyes search the room
For one friendly face is all you need to see
[Verse 7]
If there's one guy, just one guy who'd lay down his life for you and die
It's hard to say it, I hate to say it
But it's probably me
I hate to say it, I hate to say it
But it's probably me
I hate to say it, I hate to say it
But it's probably me
I hate to say it, I hate to say it
But it's probably me"

Enough, I call the bluff

That's how I go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
I go and go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
And now my pockets look gravy, with plenty to give
Somebody 'bout to have my baby and the key to my crib
That's how I go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
I go and go, that's how I go girl, that's how I go girl
That's how we go"

You know the one they say shawty get it low
Sipping sangria, mama mia

We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need?
[Chorus]
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free, real love
I'm searching for a real love
[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations
Lead me towards a real love
[Chorus]
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free, real love
I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

Love so true and, oh, baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stayed strong, maybe I'll find my real love
[Verse 3]
So I try my best and pray to God
He send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good loving through the summertime
Winter, spring and fall

I'm searching for a real love (For a real love, real love, real love)

You see, I'm searching for a real love (Real love)
And I don't know where to go (I'm searching for a real love)
Been around the world, been high and low (Someone to set my heart free)
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love (Real love)
'Cause it seems that's not around (I'm searching for a real love)
Gotta end it in this way because
It seems he can't be found

Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hoping that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
[Verse 1]
Grindin' to see if they think they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Ridin' with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up""
Next to the Playstation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma
Girl, you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some **** tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em
Will have a **** locked up in a maximum security cell
I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twin's steady twistin', like, ""Hit this dough!""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down, gotta stop pollution
CD change, **** like, ""Who is that producin'?""
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'
[Chorus]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hoping that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty

Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
[Verse 2]
I been drinkin' and smokin'
Holdin' shit 'cause a brother can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po-po's scope this
Big old Excursion swervin', all up in the curve, man
**** been sippin' on that Hennessy and the gin again
Sin again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on the blunt
And rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a revolver in my right hand
40 ounce in my left, freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs
Y'all, I gotta hit the backstreets
Wondering about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, glock, shots to the block, we creep, creep
Pop, pop, hope cops don't see me, on a low key
[Bridge]
With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em, like, ""Fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Roll up if you want and get it poppin' dog
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

They hoping that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
[Verse 3]
Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light, and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sure, 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drink and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rear view, and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong and keep tryin'
Steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about 'em not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you, and then I have to cruise
Jamming number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus, you can't sue
This a message to the laws, tell 'em, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they should've known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm about to pull up at your home
And it's on
[Chorus]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hoping that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

Iban hacer dos jornadas al lomo de sus caballos
La fiesta se celebraba en el Rancho del Pitayo
Su padre les dio un consejo, cuando a partir se aprestaban
""Cuiden muy bien el pellejo, porque la vida se acaba""
En las palabras del viejo, los tres hermanos pensaban
Pedro le dice a Fabián, ""Dale un trago a José Luis
Que beba de ese mezcal pa' que se sienta feliz
Que ahorita nomás al llegar nos vamos a divertir""
Cuando arribaron al baile, a bailar se dirigieron
La muerte andaba en el aire, ellos no la presintieron
Como les dijo su padre, cuando del rancho salieron
Eran muchos los rivales, viejos rencores surgieron
Rondando tras los jacales abrieron todos el fuego
Así matan los cobardes cuando los acosa el miedo
Un viejito solitario, sin esperanza ninguna
Cuida el rancho y tres caballos como toda su fortuna
Va al panteón de vez en cuando a visitar las tres tumbas"

On the plane, on my brain, 'bout to do the show
Forty K contract, take it out the door
Dice, symbolize my life, roll 'em on the floor
From your grubby hands, as you hand the grand stand

And you've clearly decided, you know how to handle me

ML262;Sting;I Hung My Head;sad;"Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
And my brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me, ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
And I see the judge high up in his chair
Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find
I said, ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head
Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
Out in the distance, a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
Now he come to fetch me to see what they done
And we'll ride together 'til kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy, for soon I'll be dead
I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head"

And I'm lookin' for a big love

Too little righteous indignation
I'm not sure if I'm mad or mean
The tears I cry could mean anything
Just cause you're kin I let it slide
Insults and judgments I've been blind
And it hard for you to deal out digs
With a calloused heart your words are quick
I'm sick and tired of throwing stones
Cause all that leaves is broken bones
And I won't shed no blood for you
Aww the cuts too deep the bruise too blue
I've wasted time and been hand fed
You can't take back the things you said
Too much time has gone and passed
Shattered lives and broken glass
The pain is felt behind my eyes
But you won't see me through my disguise
Can't change fate cause this is done
Aww too late to start the race is run
Now's the time to face the facts
This train done slid right off the tracks
Regret is sad revenge is sweet
I'm walking on my own two feet
You could have come along but you broke my heart
Now's the time for me to start
Living my life without you
Being a rock in my shoe
Can't write the book cause this one's wrote
Time's a friend and love's a foe
The future's mine indeed it's grand
You ain't a part of my plan
When you lay down and think of me
There won't be much serenity
Just know that the aching in your brain
Is the sound of your soul's grief and pain

And you know where you're going

I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said

Then you say go slow
I fall behind

You can look
And you will find me

And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering If I'm OK

Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost

ML295;Camilo Sesto;Tarde O Temprano;sad;"¿Quién no busca un amor cuando se enfrenta a la soledad?
¿Quién no sueña despierto y cierra sus ojos a la realidad?
¿Quién es del todo feliz, si no pasó alguna noche sin dormir?
Por algún amor o alguna ilusión
¿Quién no estrecha una mano cuando le ofrecen algo más que amistad?
¿Quién no ha escrito jamás una carta de amor que no se atreve a mandar?
¿Quién, no importa la edad, no tuvo un romance en un rincón de un portal?
Y amó bajo el manto de la oscuridad
Tarde o temprano, algún sueño se cumple
Y pasan los días sin que el cielo se nuble
Tarde o temprano, hay alguna razón
Para abrir el corazón
¿Quién, si es suyo el error, no llama a quien ama y le pide perdón?
¿Y a quién no le faltó el valor? Colgó el teléfono al oír su voz
¿Quién nunca lloró por algo, por alguien que no pudo alcanzar?
¿Quién no es capaz de perdonar?
Tarde o temprano, algún sueño se cumple
Y pasan los días sin que el cielo se nuble

En la noche incesante
De la humanidad
Busco ya entre la oscuridad
Esa luz que me dé libertad
Mi llanto se deja escuchar
Hoy es mi primer despertar
Todo es tan grande y pequeño
Descubro que hay sueños
Descubro miradas que enfrían mi piel
Veo del mundo lo bello y lo cruel
Hay palabras que rompen mi hiel
Pero donde existe el dolor
Siempre hay una semilla de amor
Amor en silencio
Es vivir un momento a tiempo
Amor en silencio
Es en un beso amar
O dar perdón sin explicar
Solo un alma desnuda
Esa dicha puede lograr
Amor en silencio
Es andar a favor del viento
Amor en silencio
Es de Dios la manera
De enseñarnos la verdad
Es ganar en la vida el amor
Con voluntad
Y aprendí a callar porque creo
Que es mejor
Pero hablan mis ojos en nombre
Del amor
Hay palabras que muerden y hieren
Sin razón
Pues lo más grande y puro lo dice
El corazón
Amor en silencio
Es vivir un momento a tiempo
Amor en silencio
Es en un beso amar
O dar perdón sin explicar
Solo un alma desnuda
Esa dicha puede lograr
Amor en silencio
Es andar a favor del viento

Porque justo en ese día se casaba mi querer
Ella llegó acompañada del padrino
La llevaba a su destino que nunca imaginó
Por un momento tuve toda la ilusión
De que en aquel anillo yo le daba el corazón
A la salida de la iglesia engalanada
Ella estaba ya casada la mujer que yo amé
Entre vivas de parientes y de amigos
Me acerqué para desearle fuese siempre muy feliz
Pero resulta que ella no se imaginaba
Encontrarme cara a cara y no supo que decir
Se fue llorando sin pensar que con su llanto
Su vestido iba mojando al llorar sólo por mí

[Verse 2]
What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you?
Well I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

And realize this isnt over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
Sometimes there can be so much more beyond what we see
Sometimes Im amazed how we see the world in different ways
And were just too scared to try
When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So lets take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isnt over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
Sometimes Im afraid of what I might not get to say
And were just too scared to try
Yeah were just too scared to try
When it feels like there is nothing left
It feels like this is as good as it gets
It feels that way sometimes
So lets take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isnt over yet
It just feels that way sometimes
So lets take a second and catch our breath
And realize this isnt over yet
It just feels that way sometimes"
ML332;Third Day;I Believe;happy;"Give me something that I can believe
And then I'll share it with
The world for everyone to see
Take away the darkness, all the pain and sadness
I know it's you that put this light inside of me

I believe in a faith that's strong
And I believe in a hope that carries on
I believe in these things and more
Most of all, most of all
I believe in love

And if I had the strength to move a mountain
Would you be amazed by all of my abilities
I guess it would not mean
Much if I didn't have love
And this is what I really
Want you all to see

I believe in a faith that's strong
And I believe in a hope that carries on
I believe in these things and more
Most of all, most of all
I believe in love
I believe in love, oh

There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

Arms are reached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walked with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me at these four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's the sad old padre
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
When again I'll touch the green green grass of home
They'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home"

You make your children breathe in to survive
[Chorus]
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit

And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds
[Refrain]
Fight, fight
Fight, fight

You'll never grow up to be a big rock star
Celebrated victim of your fame
They'll just cut our wrists like cheap coupons
And say that death was on sale today

And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds

But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit

The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of millions is just a statistic

To a God that doesn't exist
And I'm not a slave
To a world that doesn't give a shit
But I'm not a slave
To a God that doesn't exist

To a world that doesn't give a shit

A million miles away

Is she loving him in her mind

ML412;Emmylou Harris;Queen Of The Silver Dollar;relaxed;"She arrives in all her splendor each night at nine o'clock
Her chariot is the crosstown bus that stops right down the block
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in
And the queen of the Silver Dollar's home again
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, she rules this smokey kingdom
Her scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her tryin' to win her favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Now her royal dress is satin, it's shabby and it's torn
The royal jewels are rhinestones, the shoes are scuffed and worn
Of the many roads she's been down and the places that she's seen
Well, they all look at her and say, ""God save the queen""
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, she rules this smokey kingdom
Her scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her tryin' to win her favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Now the queen of the Silver Dollar is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But there's a man who found her and he brought her to this world
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl
Yes, I'm the queen of the Silver Dollar, I rule this smokey kingdom
My scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Yes, I'm the queen of the Silver Dollar, I rule this smokey kingdom
My scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home"

Gee it's been a long time
How's that new man, mama and dad?
Since I told you goodbye
Well I'm still the same, still raising cane
Nobody's worried about me
I come and I go, just as I please
Since I set myself free
But I can't win for losing you, I just can't get over you
Being foot loose and fancy free, ain't all it's creaked to be
And the grass ain't no greener here on the other side
I might win a heart or two but I can't win for losing you
Well I'm on my way, there's so much to say
Lord knows that I've had my time
But girl you can bet, I'll never forget
When you used to be mine
But I can't win for losing you, I just can't get over you

Though people may try to guess
The secret of our happiness
But some of them never learn, it's a simple thing
The secret I'm a-speaking of
Is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song that I always sing

I spent my whole day just thinking of you
When I walked through the front door my whole life was changed
'Cause nobody answered when I called your name
A note on the table that told me goodbye
Said you'd grown weary of living a lie
Oh your love has ended but mine still remains
But nobody answers when I call your name

Is driving me insane
And just like rain the tears keep falling

ML435;Black Sabbath;The Devil Cried;angry;"[Verse 1]
One fine day in Hell
The master told a story
Someone lied so well
He sent him back to glory

[Chorus 1]
There are whispers between the screams
That this deed can be done
Even sinners must dream
And I can be the one to make the Devil cry

[Verse 2]
I can win this game
If all things come together
I know this sounds quite strange
I won't be smart, just clever

[Chorus 2]
It's the law on the other side
Just the kill lets you run
And though many have tried
I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cry

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
At last my time has come
I must not give him pleasure
I can be the one
One chance or burn forever

[Chorus 3]
So I told him about my pain
And the life I've been through
He just smiled and the laughter came
Then I told him that I love you and the Devil cried

[Outro]
Tears from his eyes
Eyes of fire
And the Devil cried

ML436;The Who;Long Live Rock;sad;"[Verse 1]
Down at The Astoria, the scene was changin'
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating
We were the first band to vomit in the bar
And find the distance to the stage too far
Meanwhile, it's gettin' late at ten o'clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

Long live rock
I need it every night
Long live rock
Come on and join the line
Long live rock
Be it dead or alive
[Verse 3]
People walk in sideways, pretendin' that they're leavin'
We put on their makeup and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box wonderin' where the band's gone
Back in the pub, the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock
[Verse 4]
Long live rock
I need it every night
Long live rock
Come on and join the line

Be it dead or alive

Landslide, rocks are fallin'
Fallin' down 'round our very heads
We tried, but you were yawnin'
Look again
Rock is dead
Rock is dead
Rock is dead
[Verse 6]
The place is really jumpin' to the high-watt amps
Till a twenty-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps
In the blackout they dance right into the isle
And as the doors fly open, even the promoter smiles
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock

To take away my only dream

All this love melting under blues skies
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love

Well, baby, I surrender
To the strawberry ice cream never-ever-ender
Oh this love
Well, I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love
Ah ah

These lines of lightning mean we're never alone, never alone
No, no

Come on, come on, move a little closer
Come on, come on, I wanna hear you whisper
Come on, come on, settle down inside my love
Ah ah, come on, come on, jump a little higher
Come on, come on, if you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on, you were once upon a time in love

ML465;Fistful Of Mercy;Father's Son;sad;"My father he done told me
To never ever hurt no one
But now I'm sick an' mad and I been caught red handed
And I'm still father's son

I lay awake til daylight
A pillow and a gun
And if my secret dreams could be seen on screen
Then they'll be coming for this one

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Please lord now forgive me
Even though I don't deserve
I never was too good in life
The devil's all I serve
My woman she done left me
I told twice to go
The first time she ignored me
But then I threw her on the floor

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
Well I sleep with one eye open
I weep with both eyes closed
Darkness coming down on me and
Tomorrow never knows

Ever I suffer
Ever suffer my fill
And if you don't pray for me now
Nobody ever will

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Now I'm in the graveyard
It's darkness all around
Voices floating through the air speaking with no sound
You were your father's son
But you left him far beyond
Beyond the reach of mercy
In the darkness of the sun

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
I'm so down low better slow down lord
I'm so down low better slow down lord
I'm so down low better slow down lord"

ML469;Los Tigres Del Norte;Jose Perez Leon;sad;"Él era un hombre de campo
Oriundo de Nuevo León
Tenía apenas 19 años
Su nombre, José Pérez León
Tenía un primo lejano
Que de mojado se fue
Al poco tiempo le envió un telegrama
Diciendo: ""Ven pronto, José""
Pues un trabajo le había ya encontrando
Piscando algodón como él
Y se fue, y se fue
Ahogando el llanto en el adiós
Con su mujer se fue
Sin saber
Que de ese viaje ya jamás iba a volver
Pobre José
Cuando llegó a la frontera
Con Willy se entrevistó
Era el pollero más afamado
Y astuto de la región
Le dijo: ""Pepe, hoy estás de suerte
Mañana te cruzo yo""
La madrugada de un viernes
En una vieja estación
Treinta inocentes pagaban su cuota
Entre ellos, José Pérez León
Y sin dudarlo a todos metieron
En el interior de un vagón
El tren cruzó al otro lado
Casi siete horas después
Fue cuando el aire empezó a terminarse
Y ya nada pudieron hacer
Nadie escuchó aquellos gritos de auxilio
Y la puerta no quiso ceder
Uno por uno se fueron cayendo
Y así falleció el buen José
Y se fue, y se fue
A cruzar el cielo con sus ansias de crecer
Se fue sin saber
Que ya su esposa un hijo suyo iba a tener
Pobre José
Así termina la historia
No queda más que contar
De otro paisano que arriesga la vida
Y que muere como ilegal
De aquel José que mil sueños tenía
Y que a casa jamás volverá"

While an old love song's creeping into your head

If you were dreaming of me again

With the curtains closed I can't tell if it's night
But I know for sure that this sure feels right
With you here between my arms

ML484;Mark Schultz;Love Has Come;happy;"Well, I know this life is filled with sorrow
And there are days when the pain just lasts and lasts
But I know there will come a day
When all our tears are washed away with a break in the clouds
His glory coming down and in that moment
Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, everyone will see
That God is love and love has come for us all
For anybody who has ever lost a loved one
And you feel like you had to let go too soon
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But don't you know it's just a matter of time 'til the tears are gonna end
You'll see him once again and in that moment
Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, everyone will see
That God is love and love has come for us all
Oh, and on that day we will stand amazed
At our savior, God and king
Just to see the face of amazing grace
As our hearts rise up and sing
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Thank You for the cross
Singing glory, glory, hallelujah
Christ has paid the cost
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Thank You for the cross

And You said, ""Come and follow me""
But I had to give up everything
All I once held dear and all of my dreams
Would I love You enough to let go?
Or would my love run dry
When You asked for my life?
When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
If You're all You claim to be
Then I'm not losing anything
So I will crawl upon my knees
Just to know the joy of suffering
I will love You enough to let go
Lord, I give you my life
I give you my life
When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me

You can have me
I want to be where You are
(You can have me)
I'm running into Your arms
(You can have me)
And I will never look back

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?

ML501;Jeremias;Hay Un Amor Afuera;sad;"Con un llanto empieza el baile
De la vida sin que alguien
Te explique como es

En un mundo al revez
Donde lo unico seguro
Siempre es un tal vez

Anda sin avanzar
Guardando de a poquito
El tiempo en el ayer

Remando río arriba
Cada noche, cada día
Sabiendo que

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir
Caminando en la corniza
Entre la rabia y la risa
Se va la juventud

Detrás de un cielo azul
Que se quedo en fotografías
Dentro de un baúl

Un barco en baja mar
Volver de la oficina
A punto de llorar

Pero la luna llena
Que una noche desempeña
En recordar

Que hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir
Cada cual tiene un boleto
Que nos lleva
Lejos de la soledad

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir"

Para no desterrarla ahora y para siempre de mi corazón
Yo soy así, y seguiré
Vagando errante por tu piel
Yo no podré dar todo de mí
Mientras que olvide a esa mujer
Y sigo esclavo de sus besos
Y sigo preso de mis miedos
Hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión

Está apartándome de ti
Y sigo esclavo de sus besos
Y sigo preso de mis miedos
Y sigo sin saber por qué razón
Sigue ella en mi interior

Hasta he intentado escapar de aquí
Pero me cuesta renunciar a ti
Parece ser que voy del norte al sur una vez más

Es como un barco que navega perdido
Yo sólo quiero rescatar, rescatar lo perdido

A veces pienso que esto es el final
Que no hay motivos para continuar
Pero yo siento que te quiero aún incluso más
Y si me quieres para qué pensar
Mientras tú piensas, la vida se va
Mañana es tarde para regresar a este lugar

Algo de ti está acabando conmigo
Algo de mí se está muriendo contigo

Something that's unbelievable
We been building on the slow but to see it come together
It's like a dream's achievable
We had bumps along the way, quite a few surprises
But we held fast, dealt with all the compromises
Put our pride aside how we sacrifice so long
For something we could call our own
Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
I used to think of all the things we've overcome
As just our history
But now I know that all the things we built together
Will be our legacy
The world will know that we were here
Our intent to stay sincere, our purpose and hearts were clear
Our babies will have babies of their own
And our love will live on for generations to come
Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it
Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
Every step, solid rock as a foundation
And a roof made of hope for our protection
A room of opportunity driven by affection
And every room I put my heart
And if these walls they could talk
They would keep you up all night
Telling you the first day
We moved to our biggest fight
Make so many memories
So here's and extra set of keys
Love made it whicha share it
Whicha right here in this house
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

Watching the men always looking down
Sometimes I feel like an animal
In the zoo, staring out
No one looks me in the eye
They save it for the girls inside
I don't much care what they see
I know she saves it all for me
Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one

Borró mis heridas
Y fui descubriendo
Mi propia verdad
Un sueño en mis brazos
Mi fiel compañía
Un amor sincero
Que tú no me das

Buscando un amor que no apareció
Con él yo consigo
Tocar el sentimiento que en ti me faltó

My heart
These words are my own

Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you
I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration (But it's not coming easily)

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?
Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhyme, see you later

From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you (I love you, I love you)
[Verse 2]
Read some Byron, Shelley and Keats
Recited it over a Hip-Hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killer hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough
[Chorus]
These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you (I love you, I love you)

From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say

The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposé
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

ML705;Apocalyptica;Bring Them To Light ;angry;"He's large and ugly giant monster, headless on my back
This urgent haste in my head, materialized in this dark whole world
No one can help me there, I know this pain has gone too far
The fear is now so loud
Kill a child, I'm trying to protect myself
Against your old controlled hate
Pollution of mind filled all the space and destroyed my light
At least mine were never allowed
The hardest thing to me is facing the fear I live
No one can help me now, it's under my heart
I'll come to know the living, my demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light
I wanted to hate, I wanted to die
I wanted to see you sacrifice
I had to deal with the fear you gave me
But you fucker never tried to help me
I was jealous and I was scared
Nobody ever replaced my pain
To say I'm not evil, to tell I'm not bad
Too late, I'm lost in human nature
Leave me be
Set me free
Leave me be
Set me free
The hardest thing to me is facing the fear I live
No one can help me now, it's under my heart
I'll come to know the living, my demons are inside
I'll bring them all to light
Unexpected yet expected, emerged from the dark I come to life
You know me, you fear me, always me knocking at your door, always around
Insulted, disrespected, return to the dark into this life
You know me, you fear me
You know me, you fear me
You know me, you fear me
You know me, you fear me
You fear me
You fear me
The hardest thing to me is facing the fear I live
No one can help me now, it's under my heart

Sin tenerles compasión vilmente los torturaron
Y ya muertos, con un carro por encima les pasaron
En la colonia El Palmito, la ciudad fue Culiacán
Andaban Francisco López, también Francisco Beltrán
Ellos no se imaginaban que los iban a matar
Francisco López tenía unas cuentas atrasadas
Había matado derecho al que le robó a su amada
Pero Francisco Beltrán no tenía culpa de nada
Otro día los encontraron al amanecer el día
Tenían las tripas de fuera y un perro se las comía
Unos momentos después, llegaba la policía
Con la banda sinaloense los fueron a sepultar
Y dos madresitas lloran sin poderse consolar
Por sus hijos adorados que ahorita en el cielo están
Ya con esta me despido, y les digo en mi cantar
Que las malas compañías nada bueno han de dejar
Lo digo por el corrido, no se les vaya a olvidar"

And I hope you're wishing on that same bright star
I wonder, I pray
And I sleep alone, I cry alone
And it's so hard living here on my own
So please, come home soon
Come home soon
I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I'll wear our lucky penny
Round my neck, pressed to my heart
I wonder, I pray
I sleep alone, I cry alone
And it's so hard living here on my own
So please, come home soon
I still imagine your touch
It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance
I wonder, I pray
I sleep alone, I cry alone
Without you this house is not a home
So please, come home soon
I'll walk alone, I'll try alone
And I'll wait for you
Don't want to die alone
So please, come home soon

ML712;Garth Brooks;Standing Outside The Fire;angry;"We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned
We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow, and the shame
That always comes with getting burned
But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall
We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And further forsake it all
They're so hell-bent on giving, walking haywire
Convinced it's not living, if you stand outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul
Constantly yearning, to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire"

An old familiar invitation always arrives
And I may hate myself in the morning

But it ain't easy moving on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again?

Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feeling a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be
Before everything went bad

ML719;Elvis Costello;One Bell Ringing;sad;"Rain slapping on a window pane
An hour or two of teeming
Storm punching like a hurricane
That tore him out of dreaming
Air screaming through the slightest gap
Rattling between the frame and the sill
Drapes hanging from the final act
When I had you still
One lonely bird is singing
Lower the hood on his lament
Dash him down on the cold cement
One bell ringing
Flies buzzing 'round the strip search light
They've got him down on his knees
He dreams of honey dripping from a spoon
Girls whispering in Portuguese
Between the muzzle and the black site
Electrical contact
Deny your name, then carry the blame
Somewhere after the fact
One lonely bird is singing
Lower the hood of his lament
Dash him down on the cold cement
One bell ringing"

He had diamonds on his fingers and a smile sweet
Fine red suit had the whole town talking

Yeah, Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin
In his Cadillac to Heaven he was waving his banner
He left like he lived, in a lively manner
With hundred dollar bills in his fingers tight
He had flowers for wheels and flashing headlights
He been wishing for wings, no way he was walking

Called the rainbow
I wanna see your rainbow
The rainbow tells me this storm has passed

Reproche con rabia mi corazón cuando te marchaste
Alli en el colegio yo fui esa niña
En que tu besaste ha..ah
Apasionadamente me robaste la inocensia ha..ah

Quise disfrazarme pensando que todo fue ilusión
Como loca anduve por encontrar a tu susesor
Sin un rumbo fijo
Fui presa facil de otros cariños valiendose de mi tristeza

Pero fue imposible encontrar tu calor
Me marcaste con tus huellas
La verdad no me arrepiento
Que me tienes que decir?

Monchy:
Te diré mi amor me lleve este cargo aqui en la conciencia
A otro lugar me tuve que ir
Por temor a herirte y que no sufrieras
Mejor calle, tambien me sentí infeliz
Te juro amor mi escudo fueron tus ""te quieros""
Otra no lleno tu espacio
Soportar estar sin ti fue un cruel tormento
Trabajando estuve para darte vida
La casita de tus ensueños

Cuando se ama de verdad

I can't begin to
Explain
How we disassemble
The parts and frame
[Verse 2]
Maybe it's the same late morning
The same no show
It's the same fucking habits
I guess we don't know
[Verse 3]
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where I saw this start
'Cause all of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where I saw this start
[Verse 4]
If there's anyone near when
We collide
We throw them in the middle
They can pick sides
[Verse 5]
As the plans turn into compromise
The promises all turn to lies
The spite builds up and I can't get through
Passive me, aggressive you
[Verse 6]
I know I nag, I moan, I know
But with a plan like this, it's way too slow
In the time it took to get this back
I could've made this work, but all I had
[Verse 7]
Was the hope that pieces would take shape
And we could watch them all fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
[Verse 8]
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where I saw this start
'Cause all of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where I saw this start"

Walking back to you
Is the hardest thing that
I can do
That I can do for you
