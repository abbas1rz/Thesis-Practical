I'm with you
I'm lonely too
What's that song
That can't be sung by two
A broken home
A broken heart
Isolated and afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone

You're not alone
Every night
I stand in your place
Every tear
On every face
Tastes the same
A broken dream
A broken heart
Isolated and afraid
Open up this is a raid
I'm gonna get it through to you
You're not alone

An open hand
An open heart
There's no need to be afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone
I'm gonna get it through to you
You're not alone",angry

[Verse 1]
Some people seem to think
They always know what's best for you
Their little minds try to
Create a world to keep you still
The bolt is thrown, the cage is locked
You saw this, don't you lie
At first you cry and then
You hate those people, stole your will

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(No nothing)

[Chorus]
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore [Verse 2]
So you just sit there stuck
Afraid to risk reality
Afraid to cause yourself
More pain to face insanity
But nothing ventured, nothing gained
You see your fear's your cage
You beg for help but
You're alone stuck in a helpless rage

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario

[Bridge]
It's me...
I see...
Please...
(Let me out, I'm petrified)
[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(C'mon)

[Chorus]
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

Fireflies swarm in the gloom
Whispers in the shadows beckon to you, so
Turn the lights out before the break of dawn
Falling Down

Hearing your heartbeat in the sudden quiet
They turn the lights out before the break of dawn

When I call you on the phone
I get a strong uneasy feeling
You're not sitting there alone

And I'm so afraid I'm gonna find you with
A so-called smokin' gun
Maybe you want to end it
You've had your fill of my kind of fun
But you don't know how to tell me
And you know that I'm not that dumb
I put 2 and 1 together
And you know that's not an even sum
And I know just where to catch you with
That well known smokin' gun
I'm standing here bewildered
I can't remember just what I've done
I can hear the sirens whining
My eyes blinded by the sun
I know that I should be running

Grindin' to see if they think they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Ridin' with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up""
Next to the Playstation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma
Girl, you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some **** tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em
Will have a **** locked up in a maximum security cell
I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twin's steady twistin', like, ""Hit this dough!""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down, gotta stop pollution
CD change, **** like, ""Who is that producin'?""

Sin again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on the blunt
And rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a revolver in my right hand
40 ounce in my left, freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs
Y'all, I gotta hit the backstreets
Wondering about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, glock, shots to the block, we creep, creep
Pop, pop, hope cops don't see me, on a low key

With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em, like, ""Fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all

Turn on my blinker light, and then I swang it slow

So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rear view, and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong and keep tryin'
Steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about 'em not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you, and then I have to cruise
Jamming number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus, you can't sue
This a message to the laws, tell 'em, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they should've known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm about to pull up at your home

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?

So I will crawl upon my knees

Tiene un impedimento para esta boda
Que lo diga hoy o que calle para siempre
La iglesia estaba toda iluminada
Mucha gente fue invitada, yo también estaba ahí
Nadie sabe la tristeza que sentía
Porque justo en ese día se casaba mi querer
Ella llegó acompañada del padrino
La llevaba a su destino que nunca imaginó
Por un momento tuve toda la ilusión
De que en aquel anillo yo le daba el corazón
A la salida de la iglesia engalanada
Ella estaba ya casada la mujer que yo amé
Entre vivas de parientes y de amigos
Me acerqué para desearle fuese siempre muy feliz
Pero resulta que ella no se imaginaba
Encontrarme cara a cara y no supo que decir
Se fue llorando sin pensar que con su llanto
Su vestido iba mojando al llorar sólo por mí
Pero resulta que ella no se imaginaba
Encontrarme cara a cara y no supo que decir
Se fue llorando sin pensar que con su llanto
Su vestido iba mojando al llorar sólo por mí",sad

Que tu amor se descubre
El castigo de ayer
Que me diste tan cruel

No perturbes jamás

De mis sueños dorados

So quiet, but I finally woke up
If you're sad, then it's time you spoke up, too

De la vida sin que alguien
Te explique como es

En un mundo al revez
Donde lo unico seguro
Siempre es un tal vez

Anda sin avanzar
Guardando de a poquito
El tiempo en el ayer

Remando río arriba
Cada noche, cada día
Sabiendo que

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir
Caminando en la corniza
Entre la rabia y la risa
Se va la juventud

Detrás de un cielo azul
Que se quedo en fotografías
Dentro de un baúl

Un barco en baja mar
Volver de la oficina
A punto de llorar

Pero la luna llena
Que una noche desempeña
En recordar

Que hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir
Cada cual tiene un boleto
Que nos lleva

There's too many kings
Wanna hold you down
And the world at the window
Gone underground
There's a hole in the sky
Where the sun don't shine
And a clock on the wall
And it counts my time

And heaven is the whole of our hearts
And heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, heaven is the whole of our hearts
And heaven don't tear you apart

There's a song on the air with a 'love you' line
And a face in a glass and it looks like mine
And I'm standing on ice when I say that I don't hear planes
And I scream at the fools wanna jump my train

And heaven is the whole of our hearts
And heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, heaven is the whole of our hearts
And heaven don't tear you apart

En algún lugar de un gran país
Olvidaron construir
Un hogar donde no queme el sol
Y al nacer no haya que morir

Y en la sombra
Mueren genios sin saber
De su magia
Concedida, sin pedirlo
Mucho tiempo antes de nacer

No hay camino que
Llegue hasta aquí
Y luego pretenda salir
Con el fuego de
El atardecer, arde la hierba

Que se marcha, con el viento
Mientras grita que no va a volver

Es de otro color
El polvo lo debe saber
Los hombres ya no
Saben si lo son
Pero lo quieren creer
Las madres que ya
No saben llorar
Ven a sus hijos partir
La tristeza aquí
No tiene lugar
Cuando lo triste es vivir",sad

Traveling through this world alone

I know my pathway is rough and steep
But golden fields lie out before me
Where weary eyes no more will weep
