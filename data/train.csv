Right... (turn the lights off)

There goes my baby
(Ooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Ooh, girl, look at you

Bet you ain't know that I be checking you out when you be putting your heels on
I swear, your body's so perfect, baby
How you work it, baby yeah, whoo!
I love the way that you be poking it out, girl
Give me something to feel on
So please believe we gone be twerking it out
By the end of the night, baby

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
(Not even for a minute)
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon' hear me say

There goes my baby
(Ooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Ooh, girl, look at you

I get the chills whenever I see your face and you in the place, girl
Feel like I'm in a movie, baby
I'm like, ""Oowee, baby""
Like waterfalls, your hair falls down to your waist
Can I get a taste, girl?
No need to creep, 'cause baby, I ain't ashamed
Of calling your name, girl

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon' hear me say

There goes my baby
(Ooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Ooh, girl, look at you

And girl, I feel like it's our first time every time we get together
Baby, loving you feels better than
Everything, anything
Put on my heart, you don't need a ring
And I promise
Our time away won't change my love

There goes my baby
(Ooh, girl, look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Ooh, girl, look at you

2,daville,"Hidden underneath the floor
In the attic of my dreams, there's somebody I adore
I could smile, I could lie
Say, I never think about you at all, most of the time

Maybe it's the way the clouds are painted a perfect shade of yellow all across the sky
Maybe it's the way the times are changing, and I'm stuck in the middle, frozen in a fire
But, baby, you're on my mind

Doors will open, doors will close
In the basement of my dreams, there's somebody I ignore, mm
Yeah, I'm a fool, don't be surprised
I don't ever think about you at all
But right now, I just need you to know

Maybe it's the way the clouds are painted a perfect shade of yellow all across the sky
Maybe it's the way the times are changing, and I'm stuck in the middle, frozen in a fire
But, baby, you're on my mind

You showed up
Crystal and casually
Our love was what it had to be
You showed up
Like you're still attached to me
Our love was what it had to be (had to be, had to be)

Maybe it's the way the clouds are painted a perfect shade of yellow all across the sky
Maybe it's the way the times are changing, and I'm stuck in the middle, frozen in a fire

And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time

So what good would living do me?

Deeper and deeper and deeper

As I dream to live a life that seems to be

A lost reality

That can never find a way to reach my inner

Self-esteem is low, how deep can I go

In the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to

See through the gray that clouds my mind?

This time I look to see what's between the lines

The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry, ow!

It folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

Enraged my mind starts to smoke

Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face

Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air

Enraged my mind starts to smoke

I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise

And I smell like shit
Peel me off this Velcro seat
And get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell and I lost the key
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise

And I smell like shit
I got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for no motivation
Smoking my inspiration
I sit around and watch the phone
But no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fuckin' lazy
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise

And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes

You might feel good around me now

Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet
Went to the corner of second and main
But there was somebody to mention
That they hoped it would rain forever (Yeah!), forever (Yeah!)
So they could drown (Yeah!) in peace
(Then I)
Went down to Hodgkin P.L
But there was nobody to answer
When I rang that doorbell forever, forever
Now I'm sad all the time

Sometimes I'd like the rain to end

Today was the day
But she threw it all away
And I could never understand
'Cause she was never one to play by the rules of the game
Her and me were so the same
(And I)
I try so hard and I never give in
And I am never satisfied until the day that I win against them
But I don't care (but I don't care, I can fade away to anywhere)
I'll follow her to anywhere (Don't stop because you might get dropped)

Ya shit can how we did it just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, New Era committed

But do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid? So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
Mic pointed at your grill like a ****?

'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists

Everybody wanna hide from the ****
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the **** (No, sir!)

And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show

It's hard to say it, I hate to say it

When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
The jury's out and your eyes search the room
For one friendly face is all you need to see

Hand out some beat-downs
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete

To recall our downfall
And the businesses that burned us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff
Fuck Manifest Destiny!

I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations
Lead me towards a real love
[Chorus]
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free, real love
I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love
[Bridge]
Love so true and, oh, baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stayed strong, maybe I'll find my real love
[Verse 3]
So I try my best and pray to God
He send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good loving through the summertime
Winter, spring and fall
[Chorus]
Real love
I'm searching for a real love (For a real love, real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free, real love
I'm searching for a real love
[Chorus]
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free, real love
I'm searching for a real love
[Bridge]
You see, I'm searching for a real love (Real love)
And I don't know where to go (I'm searching for a real love)
Been around the world, been high and low (Someone to set my heart free)
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love (Real love)
'Cause it seems that's not around (I'm searching for a real love)
Gotta end it in this way because
It seems he can't be found

Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free, real love
I'm searching for a real love

I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free, real love

Iban hacer dos jornadas al lomo de sus caballos
La fiesta se celebraba en el Rancho del Pitayo
Su padre les dio un consejo, cuando a partir se aprestaban
""Cuiden muy bien el pellejo, porque la vida se acaba""
En las palabras del viejo, los tres hermanos pensaban
Pedro le dice a Fabián, ""Dale un trago a José Luis
Que beba de ese mezcal pa' que se sienta feliz
Que ahorita nomás al llegar nos vamos a divertir""
Cuando arribaron al baile, a bailar se dirigieron
La muerte andaba en el aire, ellos no la presintieron
Como les dijo su padre, cuando del rancho salieron
Eran muchos los rivales, viejos rencores surgieron
Rondando tras los jacales abrieron todos el fuego
Así matan los cobardes cuando los acosa el miedo

Cuida el rancho y tres caballos como toda su fortuna

I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
And my brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me, ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
And I see the judge high up in his chair
Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find
I said, ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head, I hung my head
Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
Out in the distance, a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
Now he come to fetch me to see what they done
And we'll ride together 'til kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy, for soon I'll be dead

Shattered lives and broken glass

And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new

Flashback to warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said

Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering If I'm OK

Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time
You said go slow

303,joan sebastian,"No, no es que extrañe tanto el sol de tu mirada
Ni es que me falte el tierno roce de tu piel
Sencillamente es que me canso de hacer nada
Y entonces tiendo a recordar
A recordar cosas de ayer
Mas no se piense que vivir sin ti no puedo
Hoy mi nostalgia tiene otra explicación
Sencillamente es que me amaneció nublado
Y el cielo gris
El cielo gris siempre me pone el corazón
Sentimental, sentimental
No, no es que extrañe tanto el dulce de tus besos
Y hasta disfruto la amargura que hay en mí
En el asfalto no florecen los cerezos
Hoy no hubo sol
Hoy no hubo sol por eso es que estoy así
Y no se piense que vivir sin ti no puedo
Hoy mi nostalgia tiene otra explicación
Sencillamente es que amaneció nublado

El cielo gris siempre me pone el corazón

Con una baraja de oro
Pues si la gano, ya estuvo
Y si la pierdo ni modo
Porque yo soy de los hombres
Que cuando pierdo, no lloro
Las mujeres son barajas
Hay que saber barajear
Pa' saber cuál es la tuya
Si la que vas a apostar
No ya después de perdido
Quieras volverla a jugar
Y si juegas sin malicia
Porque no le tienes miedo
Esperando a sota de oros
Aparece un caballero
Dispense, mi buen amigo
Es que yo llegué primero
Y ni modo del reclamo
Porque yo llegue a caballo
Estoy regando el rosal
Pa' cortar la flor de mayo
Perdóneme rey de copas
Pero yo soy de a caballo
Y el que no lo quiera creer
Que le entre a lo pantera
Pierde dinero y mujeres
Y hasta la portamonedas
Y a veces llega a su casa
Con la camisa de fuera
Y si juegas sin malicia
Porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando a sota de oros
Aparece un caballero
Dispense, mi buen amigo
Es que yo llegué primero",sad

It seems all creation, oh it's longing for You
From here to the farthest star they're worshipping You
And who am I God that You are mindful of me
I'm simple in heart, simple in song, I'm a small offering

But this is my song, my song to the King
And I stand in awe of Your majesty
And I don't have much but I give everything
(Don't have much)
For this is my song, my song to the King

It's all the creation hesitates now
(Hesitates now)
And all of the angels stops singing now
(Stops singing now)
As the King of all glory listens to my song

This is my song, my song to my King
And I stand in awe of Your majesty
And I don't have much but I give everything
For this is my song, song to my King

Is my song to my King

Lovers torn and lost along the way
Until Heaven came and rescued me

Seguro es por desdenes de mujeres
No hay golpe más mortal para los hombres
Que el llanto y el desprecio de esos seres

Si quieres disfrutar de sus placeres
Consigue una pistola si es que quieres
O cómprate una daga si prefieres
Y vuélvete asesino de mujeres

Con una sobredosis de ternura
Asfíxialas con besos y dulzura
Contágialas de todas tus locuras
Mátalas
Con flores, con canciones, no les falles
Que no hay una mujer en este mundo
Que pueda resistirse a los detalles

Despiértalas con una serenata
Sin ser un día especial, llévale flores
No importa si es la peor de las ingratas
Que tú no eres un santo sin errores

A million miles away

Is she loving him in her mind

469,los tigres del norte,"Él era un hombre de campo
Oriundo de Nuevo León
Tenía apenas 19 años
Su nombre, José Pérez León
Tenía un primo lejano
Que de mojado se fue
Al poco tiempo le envió un telegrama
Diciendo: ""Ven pronto, José""
Pues un trabajo le había ya encontrando
Piscando algodón como él
Y se fue, y se fue
Ahogando el llanto en el adiós
Con su mujer se fue
Sin saber
Que de ese viaje ya jamás iba a volver
Pobre José
Cuando llegó a la frontera
Con Willy se entrevistó
Era el pollero más afamado
Y astuto de la región
Le dijo: ""Pepe, hoy estás de suerte
Mañana te cruzo yo""
La madrugada de un viernes
En una vieja estación
Treinta inocentes pagaban su cuota
Entre ellos, José Pérez León
Y sin dudarlo a todos metieron
En el interior de un vagón
El tren cruzó al otro lado
Casi siete horas después
Fue cuando el aire empezó a terminarse
Y ya nada pudieron hacer
Nadie escuchó aquellos gritos de auxilio
Y la puerta no quiso ceder
Uno por uno se fueron cayendo
Y así falleció el buen José
Y se fue, y se fue
A cruzar el cielo con sus ansias de crecer
Se fue sin saber
Que ya su esposa un hijo suyo iba a tener
Pobre José
Así termina la historia
No queda más que contar
De otro paisano que arriesga la vida
Y que muere como ilegal
De aquel José que mil sueños tenía
Y que a casa jamás volverá",sad

And I could see just then the flashing spark
Of the match to my first smoke
Some houses are built to last
It's the couple inside that change too fast
I can see their faces looking through the glass
They're not where they belong

I want to stay with you, babe
Won't you let me stay?
You're a beautiful girl
I'm right where I belong, babe
I'm here with you
You're a beautiful girl

I see your feet at the edge of the bed
While an old love song's creeping into your head
And as your eyes just closed I could only guess
If you were dreaming of me again
Stained glass casts a flickering light
With the curtains closed I can't tell if it's night
But I know for sure that this sure feels right
With you here between my arms

I want to stay with you, babe
Won't you let me stay?

And I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
And I, I can't hear what you said
Then you say, go slow

And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you

Cierro los ojos sin mirar atrás
Las cosas buenas pesan más y más
Y tus errores tienen la virtud de hacerme mal
Hasta he intentado escapar de aquí
Pero me cuesta renunciar a ti
Parece ser que voy del norte al sur una vez más

Algo de ti está acabando conmigo
Algo de mí se está muriendo contigo

Y cada sitio es un espacio vacío
Algo sin ti es nada y pierde el sentido
Porque sin ti vivir no es más que un castigo
Es como un barco que navega perdido
Yo sólo quiero rescatar, rescatar lo perdido

A veces pienso que esto es el final
Que no hay motivos para continuar
Pero yo siento que te quiero aún incluso más
Y si me quieres para qué pensar
Mientras tú piensas, la vida se va
Mañana es tarde para regresar a este lugar

Something that's unbelievable
We been building on the slow but to see it come together
It's like a dream's achievable
We had bumps along the way, quite a few surprises
But we held fast, dealt with all the compromises
Put our pride aside how we sacrifice so long
For something we could call our own
Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
I used to think of all the things we've overcome
As just our history
But now I know that all the things we built together
Will be our legacy
The world will know that we were here
Our intent to stay sincere, our purpose and hearts were clear
Our babies will have babies of their own
And our love will live on for generations to come
Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail

I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
Every step, solid rock as a foundation
And a roof made of hope for our protection
A room of opportunity driven by affection
And every room I put my heart
And if these walls they could talk
They would keep you up all night
Telling you the first day
We moved to our biggest fight
Make so many memories
So here's and extra set of keys
Love made it whicha share it
Whicha right here in this house
This house, this house, this house

Que me eleves hasta el cielo, me enamora
Que de mi sea tu alma soñadora

Sin ti mi vida es como un remolino

Kept me as a prisoner in my home
Ground through my door and I was all alone

When he smiles on my face, his clouds all seem so out of place

And lays us down to sleep forever

Tenían las tripas de fuera y un perro se las comía
Unos momentos después, llegaba la policía
Con la banda sinaloense los fueron a sepultar
Y dos madresitas lloran sin poderse consolar
Por sus hijos adorados que ahorita en el cielo están
Ya con esta me despido, y les digo en mi cantar
Que las malas compañías nada bueno han de dejar
Lo digo por el corrido, no se les vaya a olvidar",sad

And I take my daily bread
I dream of your arms around me
As I tuck the kids in bed
I don't know what you're doing
And I don't know where you are
But I look up at that great big sky
And I hope you're wishing on that same bright star
I wonder, I pray
And I sleep alone, I cry alone
And it's so hard living here on my own
So please, come home soon
Come home soon
I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I'll wear our lucky penny
Round my neck, pressed to my heart
I wonder, I pray
I sleep alone, I cry alone
And it's so hard living here on my own
So please, come home soon
I still imagine your touch
It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance
I wonder, I pray
I sleep alone, I cry alone
Without you this house is not a home
So please, come home soon
I'll walk alone, I'll try alone
And I'll wait for you
Don't want to die alone
So please, come home soon
Come home soon (please)
Come home soon",relaxed

Ain't it just like one of us to pick up the phone
And call after a couple of drinks?
And say, how you been? I been wonderin'
That maybe you've been thinkin' 'bout me

And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

Everyone's known someone
That they just can't help but want
And even though we just can't make it work out
Well the want-to lingers on

Pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

But it ain't easy moving on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again?

Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feeling a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be
Before everything went bad

In lonely late night calls like this, that we try to find
And I may hate myself in the morning

Begging money from a man I didn't know

Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business

From a woman not approved of, I suppose

Alli en el colegio yo fui esa niña
En que tu besaste ha..ah
Apasionadamente me robaste la inocensia ha..ah

Quise disfrazarme pensando que todo fue ilusión
Como loca anduve por encontrar a tu susesor
Sin un rumbo fijo
Fui presa facil de otros cariños valiendose de mi tristeza

Pero fue imposible encontrar tu calor
Me marcaste con tus huellas
La verdad no me arrepiento
Que me tienes que decir?

Monchy:
Te diré mi amor me lleve este cargo aqui en la conciencia
A otro lugar me tuve que ir
Por temor a herirte y que no sufrieras
Mejor calle, tambien me sentí infeliz
Te juro amor mi escudo fueron tus ""te quieros""
Otra no lleno tu espacio
Soportar estar sin ti fue un cruel tormento
Trabajando estuve para darte vida
La casita de tus ensueños

Coro:

Monchy:
Vamos juntos a vivir amor una eternidad
No te volveré a perder seré tuyo hasta al final

Alexandra:
Contigo voy a vivir amor de la infancia
No te volveré a perder seré tuya hasta al final

Vamos juntos a vivir amor una eternidad

Monchy:
Las campanas de la iglesia
Comenzaron ya su canto
Nuestra espera no fue en vano

Alexandra:
Y este miedo fastidioso
Salio de mi corazón
Verte de nuevo es bendición

Lo que voy a hacer
Solo vivo extrañándote
En mis horas añorándote
La noche, tu foto y soledad
Es toda mi compañía
Y me hace solo recordar
Lo triste de mi vivir
Empiezo a sentir
Ganas de llorar
De decirte: ""Siempre te he de amar""
Que sin ti, ya más no puedo estar
Decirte que el silencio es cruel
Cuando no hay una sonrisa
Es cierto, no hay amor infiel
Cuando se ama de verdad
Cómo me haces falta
Cómo me haces falta
La noche es quieta y se oye mi voz
Te está llamando mi alma
Cómo me haces falta
Cómo me haces falta
No aguanto más, creo que partiré
La soledad me espanta
No puedo ver que mi vida se fue
Y tú haciéndome falta
Decirte que el silencio es cruel
Cuando no hay una sonrisa
Es cierto, no hay amor infiel
Cuando se ama de verdad
